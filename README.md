# monster-generator
 Hello World,
    Welcome to a world you get to create. Here is a monster generator.
    
    With a few simple clicks, we use an auto-generated server to give you a completely random and new monster. From there you can begin building your colony of fun loving creatures. Give each of your little guys docile or aggressive. If they act up you can exile them from your colony.
    
    We hope you enjoy building out your interstellar world happy coding.

    To get started mount onto your local json server using pasting this into your terminal

        json-server --watch db.json 
    
    *THE SERVER MUST MOUNT ON 3000*

    This will ensure the fetch, post, patch, and delete all run smoothly. Once the server is mounted open a new terminal and paste this into your new terminal 

        npm start 

    Amazing you're ready to be a leader of your own colony! Happy space exploration!
