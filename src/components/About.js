    Hello World,
    Welcome to a world you get to create. Here is a monster generator.
    
    With a few simple clicks, we use an auto-generated server to give you a completely random and new monster. From there you can begin building your colony of fun loving creatures. Give each of your little guys docile or aggressive. If they act up you can exile them from your colony.
    
    We hope you enjoy building out your interstellar world happy coding.</div>)
